# Python3-Card-Game
My comp sci prof had us write a class for making a deck of cards, expanded the class and turned the project into a small game. The project is very much under construction. Took about 2 hours to code since this was the first time I've converted a Java program into Python. If I get bored on a sunday afternoon I'll finish the project but otherwise it works to the specifications of the orginal Java program. 

converted from Java -> Pyhton3
